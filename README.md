I've uploaded microsatellite data from Wood duck (Aix sponsa) blood samples collected 
by myself and the UC Davis Wood Duck Project staff from 2012-2014. 
These samples came from living birds we were able to catch in hand, 
but I will eventually have microsatellites from tissues from deceased individuals.
In total we sampled 19 microsatellite locations across 3 populations of wood ducks.
